# Ravlt Audio Gui

In this folder, you'll find a
1) environment.txt or environment.yml (should be interchangeable for our purposes) which lists all the dependencies needed for this project. You can make a new conda environment using:
```bash
conda create --name my_environment --file req.txt
```
or simply create an empty environment and import the dependencies listed in req.txt manually
```bash
conda create --name my_environment
```

2) the main file called ravlt_audio_gui.py. You can run this file by typing the following command into the terminal
```bash
python ravlt_audio_gui.py
```

**USAGE**

3) After launching the code, a dialog box prompting the user to input their initials. This is just to keep of making edits and where.
4) After pressing 'Submit', a GUI will appear.
5) **Importing Data**: Press *Import* to import a partcipant folder listing the audio transcriptions. You'll see a window showing the current directory: click on the folder named RAVLT, then the participantâ€™s folder that you want to score. You should then see the name of the entire directory for that folder in the textbox at the bottom of the window.
6) **Getting Started**: Once imported, you'll see 2 other windows populate: the *Top Left* displays the .csv as edits are made; the *Top Right* displays the waveform for the audio (this will be necessary for making *Edits* and *Inserts* (see below).
7) The name of the current block (e.g. Block 1 Recall) will apppear in the *Left Column*. Once ready to begin, press *Start* and the current word will appear at the bottom of the *Middle Column* as well as be highlighted in the *Top Left* window. *Recommended*: We recommend, for any given block, to press *Play Full Audio* and listen to/make notes of all utterances. The reason for this is that the auto-transcription will sometimes miss utterances completely or overlap them with marked words and these misses will be impossible to see by simply listening to each marked utterance. Additionally, it feels a bit more efficient since you will already have an idea of where to make edits and won't have to listen to every single utterance. You can press *Play Audio Segment* to play the audio for any given line, however.
9)  **Quality Check**: *Bottom Right of GUI* Once the audio plays, the *first* thing we want to check if the speech was correctly transcribed. You do this by pressing *Accept* to validate the transcription, *For Review* for audio that may be inaudible or otherwise difficult to understand, and *Off Task* for any speech that was not an attempt to recall a word from the list (e.g. 'I'm tired', 'My parent shoud be coming to pick me up soon'). Additionally, you can press *Add Note* to add any information about a decision related to the quality check or edits.
10)  *Important Note*: For an utterance to qualify as *Off Task*, it must not relate at all to the task. Any repeats, mistakes (e.g. says 'drape' rather than 'curtain'), subvocalizations (i.e. quietly repeating words to themselves as a memory strategy), or otherwise should not be marked as *Off Task* **since those relate to the task**. However, if a participant says a word from the list (e.g. 'parent') out of the context of a recall (e.g. 'My parent shoud be coming to pick me up soon'), **this should be labeled as Off Task**.
11)  **Edits**: *Middle of GUI* There are 3 types of edits that are able to be made here: *Edit*, *Drop*, or *Insert*. To initiate an *Edit* or *Insert*, press *Start Edit/Insert*. Once the start button has been pressed, a popup window will appear when you can type in the edit/insert you want to make (**Note**: you do not *have* to type in anything when making an edit if you're only changing the *Time Data*). After pressing *Continue*, you can then provide *Time Data*. To Edit the onset/offset of the current row or provide the Insert with the onset/offset, click on the waveform, first, where the onset will be and, second, where the offset will be. For Edits, the red highlighted area over the current word will be updated; for Inserts, a blue highlighted area will be shown on the waveform. Next, press *Save Edit/Insert* and all changes will be saved (you can press *Refresh* on the *Left Column* to see your updated changes). Finally, to Drop a row, simply press the *Drop* button.
12)  After finishing all checks on the word, you will press *Next Row* to move on to the next word. 
13)  **Additional Usability**: There's a *Search* button at the *Bottom-Right of GUI* that, once pressed, a text box can be used to search for a specific word or onset (e.g. if the .csv lists 'Curtain' being said at 6.4s, you can type in 'curtain' or 6 and press *Search*). Otherwise, the *Restart*, *Refresh*, *Play Full Audio*, and *Zoom* buttons are pretty self explanatory.
14)  **Progressing** Once finished with a row, press *Next Row* to continue to check the next one. Once finished with a file, text will appear in the *Bottom-Right of GUI* saying 'Press the 'Start' button the begin the next file'. Continue validating until all files in the folder have been validated.
